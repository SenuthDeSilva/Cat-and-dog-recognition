# Object Recognition AI

## Overview
This project focuses on object recognition using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify objects such as bottles, shoes, pens, and desks from labeled image datasets.

## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning (DNNs, CNNs)
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Strengths and Weaknesses
### Deep Learning (DNNs)
**Strengths:**
- Automatic feature extraction
- High accuracy in large datasets
- Scalable for multi-class object recognition

**Weaknesses:**
- Computationally intensive
- Requires large labeled datasets

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
**Strengths:**
- Localized feature learning
- Parameter efficiency
- Robust to noise, rotations, and scaling

**Weaknesses:**
- Complex design and optimization
- High hardware requirements (GPUs needed)

## Dataset and Preprocessing
The input dataset consists of labeled images categorized into different classes. The images are organized in `train` and `test` directories and undergo preprocessing:
- Resizing to 150x150 pixels
- Normalization (pixel values scaled to [0,1])
- Data augmentation (rotations, shifts, flips) to enhance robustness

## Model Evaluation
### Testing Methods
- **Accuracy & Loss Metrics**: Measures overall performance on test data.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Identifies misclassified instances.
- **Manual Testing**: Verifies model predictions on individual images.
- **Visual Testing**: Ensures correct object recognition.

### Results
- **Test Accuracy**: 76.36%
- **Confusion Matrix**: Minimal misclassifications
- **Example Misclassifications:**
  - True Label: Bottles → Predicted Label: Desks (38 errors)
  - True Label: Shoes → Predicted Label: Pens (18 errors)

## Example Application
The model can recognize multiple objects in real-world scenarios, such as identifying cars and pedestrians in street scenes or classifying animals in wildlife photography.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of CNNs for object recognition, achieving reasonable accuracy while balancing computational complexity. Future improvements include hyperparameter tuning, dataset expansion, and architectural refinements.
